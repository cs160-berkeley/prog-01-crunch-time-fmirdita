CalorieConverter is an app that converts energy spent exercising 
into calories. The app features 12 different exercises that are either converted using 
minutes or repitions to find the quivalent in calories. 

Simply choose an exercise from a drop down menu, then input the number of reps or minutes spent on the exercise to see the converted calories. It's that simple!

This app was made as the first project of CS160 at UC Berkeley 2016.
